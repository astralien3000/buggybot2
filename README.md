## Introduction

This is the repository of Buggybot, a four-legged robot developped by a former student of ENSEIRB-MATMECA.
It participated to several robotic competitions : 

 - Robot-Wars (2013), a small competition that took place in Bordeaux in which legged robots had to kick out 
their competitors off a ring. [Here is the old repository of the robot](https://github.com/jraynal/eirobotwar).

 - Coupe de France de robotique 2015, the french division of Eurobot 2015.
